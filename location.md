# Venue

The summer school will be held at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University. The Faculty of Informatics (FI) was founded in 1994 as the first Faculty of Informatics in the Czech Republic. Today, with a steady increase of interest to study, it provides Computer Science education at all levels of university studies for two thousand students in Czech and English. In addition to quality education, there are almost twenty laboratories where researchers and students perform leading-edge research, often in cooperation with companies located in the science and technology park directly in the FI area.

# Brno City

Brno ( /ˈbɜːrnoʊ/ in English) is the second largest city of the Czech Republic and it is the county city of the beautiful South Moravia region. With around 400 000 inhabitants, Brno is still a rather small city with a welcoming, cosmopolitan atmosphere. Moreover, Brno is a very [student-friendly city](https://www.em.muni.cz/en/student/11992-10-reasons-why-brno-is-the-best-city-for-students). With students forming around 20% of its population, the city has molded itself to accommodate the student life and there are always things to do and places to go for young people.  

The city also offers dozens of historical sights to see. The cityscape is dominated by the Špilberk castle and the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul. Another architectural monument is the functionalist Villa Tugendhat, which has been included on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. You can visit also the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady and the neighboring Augustinian Abbey, where the founder of genetics – Gregor J. Mendel – was living and working on his research.

**Travelling between Brno and Vienna**<br/>
If you are coming to Brno from Vienna or are traveling to Vienna afterward, there are several possibilities of travel between the two cities. Trains are the fastest way (~1,5 hours), but several companies offer also direct coach rides (~2 hours). We recommend checking out [RegioJet](https://regiojet.cz/) (trains and coaches), [FlixBus](https://global.flixbus.com/) (coaches) or national railway companies [ČD](https://www.cd.cz/en/default.htm)/[ÖBB](https://www.oebb.at/en/) (they tend to be slightly more expensive).
